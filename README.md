# Crawler-Toy
A very simple crawler to get and analyse data from Lianjia site.
The original settings are for houses around metro line 5. Some very basic analysis and visualization are included like the influence of distance from center city.

The mini-program will firstly collect the price data of houses for sale from LianJia site and save them into a .txt file by Metro Station, named by the date of collection.  
Then it will plot:  
- Histogram of price of houses for sale around each Metro Station.  
- Influence of distance to the center city on price.  
- Trend of price on time.
